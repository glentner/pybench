Simple Performance Benchmarks for Python
========================================

The ``pybench`` command-line tool can run a number of compute-intensive performance benchmarks
and gather telemetry on not just the time to execute but also CPU and memory footprint. The
logging output generated by a run can be piped into an included graphing utility to look at
resource consumption during task execution.

The focus is on numerical and scientific computing tasks, but common pure-Python tasks are
also included. Discover tasks with ``pybench list``.

Run tasks by name and provide arguments. For example, to execute a large matrix multiplication
task 30 times for ``float64`` precision for a given size:

.. code-block::

    pybench run numpy.matmul float64 20000 --repeat 30 --spacing 10 --monitor-cpu --monitor-memory \
        |& tee output.log | pybench graph -o results.pdf --print
